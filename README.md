# imageGallery
I created this image gallery while I was learning and trying out many things.
This image gallery uses lightbox jQuery Plugin which also contained css file to make the gallery responsive. So, basically this is a responsive image gallery with little or I would say no coding.
But the UI is designed by me. Image first appears to be faded because of sepia css filter but later on when user click on one of image it image shows clearly with little bit increased size because of transform css property set to it.
When user clciks on one of image, image is displayed to it's original dimensions with faded background effect.
